The algorithms set of packages for LaTeX
----------------------------------------

The `algorithms` bundle provides two environments, `algorithmic` and
`algorithm`, designed to typeset pseudo-code with LaTeX.

The `algorithmic` package provides an environment for the description of
algorithms, step-by-step in pseudo-code, while the `algorithm`
environment provides a `float` wrapper for algorithms to "feature" them
in the text.

Even though the primary intention is to use them together, it is
possible to just use one of them at the option of the user.  The reason
for two environments being provided is to allow the user maximum
flexibility.


Development and Support
-----------------------

The source code for the bunde is currently hosted in a `git` repository
at <http://github.com/rbrito/algorithms>.

The author welcomes any contribution and also tries to address any bugs
or feature requests that may be filed on the issue tracker at
<http://github.com/rbrito/algorithms/issues>


The License
-----------

The algorithms bundle is (currently) licensed under the Lesser GPL
license, which is a Free Software license. It may, in the future, be
released under the standard LaTeX license (the Latex Project Public
License).
