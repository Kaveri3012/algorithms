       The <a href="http://algorithms.berlios.de/"><tt>algorithms</tt>
       package</a> for <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>
     </h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
       This is <a href="http://algorithms.berlios.de/">the homepage</a> of
       the algorithms package for the <a
       href="http://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX</a> typesetting system.
       Here you will find (hopefully!) all information on the package
       (including documentation and support regarding its use).
    </p>


    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
       When typesetting texts with many algorithms, many writers have
       questions regarding how they will present the algorithm to his
       readers. Showing them in a well-stablished language (say, like C)
       may be a good choice, but often, real-world languages require too
       many syntatic details to be written and such details distract the
       reader from the essence of the problem being solved.
    </p>

    <p>
       For this reason, many researchers choose to present their algorithms
       in a language that is similar to well-known languages (like C, C++,
       Java or Pascal) but with more flexibility, in what is know as
       <em>pseudo-code</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
       The <tt>algorithms</tt> package for LaTeX aims to produce
       high-quality descriptions of algorithms using pseudo-code, to convey
       the information needed for the reader in the best way (and with all
       the power of TeX at the disposal of the writer).
    </p>

    <h2>News:</h2>

    <dl>
       <dt><em>2005-07-05:</em></dt>

         <strong>
	   Line references and line numbering features.
         </strong>
         <br />
	 The new version of algorithms incorporates two frequently
         requested features:
	 <ul>
	    <li>
	      The ability of using \label's and \ref's for making
              references to specific lines of a given algorithm;
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      The ability of changing both the size and delimiters of line
              numbering. You can specify any size you wish and use (almost)
              any string as the delimiter of the line numbering generated
              by the package.
	    </li>
	 </ul>
       </dd>

       <dt><em>2005-05-29:</em></dt>
       <dd>
         <strong>
	   Now with <em>screenshots</em> too!
         </strong>
         <br />
        
	 I have put a <a href="./files/example.pdf">new document</a> (in
	 PDF format) to serve as an example of use of <tt>algorithms</tt>
	 and I included <a href="./screenshots.html">a "screenshot"</a>
	 taken from that document.<br />

	 By the way, if you have any feature that you would like to see
	 implemented in the package, please register it <a
	 href="http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?func=addfeature&group_id=3442">here</a>
	 so that I can keep track of which enhancements to implement.
       </dd>

       <dt><em>2005-05-08:</em></dt>
       <dd>
         <strong>
	   A new version of <tt>algorithms</tt> has been released!
         </strong>
         <br />
        
	 The new version incorporates the ability to set up arbitrary
	 indentation of pseudo-code. This is especially useful when
	 submitting papers to journals with space constraints, as you can
	 remove the "end for", "end if", "end while" etc constructs without
	 being concerned with loss of readability.<br />

	 The manual was also updated to document it clearly and the
         infra-structure of this release will allow easier future
         enhancements.
       </dd>

         <strong>
	   The initial commit to the <a
           href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> repository
           was made today.
         </strong>
         <br />
        
	 I will now try to use the svn tools more frequently, as I gain
	 more familiarity with them.
